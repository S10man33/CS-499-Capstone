# CS-499 Capstone: Mobile Inventory Management App

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone project, a Kotlin-based mobile inventory management application that reflects my evolution from procedural programming to scalable, cloud-integrated architecture. This repository showcases enhancements across software design, algorithms, and database integration, aligned with SNHU’s CS-499 course outcomes.

## 📱 Project Overview

This Android application allows users to register, log in, and manage inventory items in real time. Originally developed in Java, the app was refactored to Kotlin and enhanced with Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and modular architecture. It demonstrates my ability to design maintainable systems, optimize performance, and apply test-driven development principles.
