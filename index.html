            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been a transformative experience that not only deepened my technical expertise but also reshaped my professional identity and long-term career goals. Entering the program with over 25 years of experience in hardware repair and technical support, I brought a strong foundation in troubleshooting and process-driven environments. However, the curriculum challenged me to evolve into a full-stack software developer capable of designing scalable, maintainable, and secure applications. Through rigorous coursework, collaborative projects, and iterative enhancement of my ePortfolio, I developed proficiency in object-oriented programming, cloud database integration, modular architecture, and test-driven development. The capstone experience, in particular, allowed me to synthesize these skills into a cohesive Android inventory application that reflects both technical depth and user-centered design. This portfolio now serves as a professional showcase of my ability to solve complex problems, communicate effectively with diverse audiences, and deliver production-ready software aligned with industry standards.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 1: Collaborative Environments</strong><br />
                Throughout the program, I employed strategies for building collaborative environments by participating in peer code reviews, group discussions, and iterative feedback loops. In my final project, I integrated feedback from instructors and peers to improve modularity and test coverage. I also used GitHub for version control and issue tracking, which enabled asynchronous collaboration and decision-making across diverse audiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 2: Professional Communication</strong><br />
                I designed and delivered professional-quality written and visual communications through enhancement summaries, structured documentation, and this ePortfolio. My code review video demonstrates oral communication skills, while my artifact narratives reflect technical clarity and audience awareness. I adapted my communication style to suit both technical stakeholders and academic reviewers, ensuring coherence and professionalism.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 3: Algorithmic Solutions</strong><br />
                My Binary Search Tree artifact showcases my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles. I implemented recursive traversal, comparator injection, and performance tuning to manage trade-offs between readability and efficiency. These enhancements reflect a deep understanding of algorithmic design and problem-solving standards.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 4: Innovative Techniques and Tools</strong><br />
                I demonstrated innovation by transitioning from local SQLite to Firebase Realtime Database, integrating Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous execution, and applying dependency injection for testability. My Inventory Management App reflects industry-specific goals such as scalability, maintainability, and cloud integration. These tools and techniques were selected to deliver real-world value.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 5: Security Mindset</strong><br />
                I developed a security mindset by implementing input validation and structured error handling in my FirebaseRepository.kt artifact. These measures help prevent malformed data from reaching the database and ensure that operations fail gracefully when unexpected conditions arise. While I have not yet implemented retry logic, I have outlined plans to add it in future iterations to improve offline resilience and data consistency. I also intend to incorporate role-based access control and field-level validation to further mitigate risks such as unauthorized access and data leakage. These enhancements reflect a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities in cloud-connected applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                The artifacts in this portfolio reflect my growth across these domains. Each one demonstrates a different facet of my skill set: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and cloud-based database integration. Together, they form a cohesive narrative of my evolution as a developer—one who values clarity, scalability, and maintainability.
            </p>

            <p>
                This self-assessment serves as both an introduction to my technical capabilities and a reflection of the values I bring to software development. I am confident that the skills and principles I’ve cultivated throughout this program will make me a valuable contributor to any development team.
