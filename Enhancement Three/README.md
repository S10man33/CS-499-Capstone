# Enhancement Three: Databases

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This enhancement showcases the transition from a local SQLite implementation to a cloud-based Firebase Realtime Database. It reflects my growth in cloud integration, asynchronous programming, and secure CRUD operations. The refactor focused on modularizing the repository layer, enforcing input validation, and applying structured error handling to support resilient, testable data flows.

## ðŸ”§ Key Enhancements

- Replaced SQLite with Firebase Realtime Database for real-time sync and scalability
- Modularized repository interface to decouple Firebase logic from UI components
- Implemented centralized input validation for secure data entry
- Applied structured error handling using a sealed `OperationResult` type
- Designed coroutine-compatible suspend functions for non-blocking operations
- Improved testability through abstraction and mockable interfaces

## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated

- Cloud database integration and asynchronous programming  
- Secure CRUD operations with validation and error resilience  
- Coroutine-based architecture for responsive UI behavior  
- Testability design through modular repository patterns  
- Logging and traceability for debugging and monitoring
